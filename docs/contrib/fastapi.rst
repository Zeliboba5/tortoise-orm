================================
Tortoise-ORM FastAPI integration
================================

We have a lightweight integration util ``tortoise.contrib.fastapi`` which has a single function ``register_tortoise`` which sets up Tortoise-ORM on startup and cleans up on teardown.

FastAPI is basically Starlette + Pydantic, but in a very specific way.
Document LOTS MORE!
